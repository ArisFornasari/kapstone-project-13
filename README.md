## Retrospective SummaryTeam:

Alona Azure, Aris Fornasari, Aden Lehman, andEric Castillo.The group that we had was great. We all worked reallygood together, we had noproblems with communication which was a huge partof getting our assignment done, we alsohad no problems meeting and setting up times to worktogether. We all decided to create anentertainment app and immediately everyone had ideasand all of our ideas seemed to mergetogether perfectly.We broke down the jobs pretty fast, Aden was ProductOwner, Aris was our ScrumMaster, and Eric and I were Quality Assurance. Arisand Aden designed our app, adding coolfeatures to it such as the Marval intro theme, andthe fonts for the title and header of our movieapp. Aris did the backend with the help of Aden andMia Peace. I did our movie database, the apifor our movie database I used was a third party IMDBapi from Axios. I was able to displaymovies, tv shows, and video games using this api,Aris and I fixed the click function for that apibecause at first you couldn’t click on the movie toopen the information about the movie, butafter sitting with DeQan Mitchell in study hall, wewere able to fix the problem.I added a star rating to our movies that includeda hover function that way you didn’thave to click on each star to rate the movie, tv show,or video game.Aris did the sign in and signup page, Aden always kept us on task and would spendhours getting our app routed andfunctional. Aden got everything working the way itwas supposed to and routed so that we couldsee everything coming together the way it was supposedto. If there were any problems Adenwould take control and would literally have it workingthe next day.Eric helped with any bugs that we had, and made sureeverything was working correctly.It was a job that we all took on together but Ericreally did a great job looking up information onthe errors we were getting and finding solutions onhow to fix them. Eric was a great comic reliefas well, there was never a dull moment in our groupbecause of Eric and he never let us getstressed out. As a team I think he was a great partof it, always ready to work and meet up andwould spend hours with us coming up with ideas ofhow to make our app work and get the fullfunctionality we needed.Overall I think that our group did an amazing job,we all just worked so well together, theassessment was challenging especially the watchlistand that was something we all didn’t thinkwas going to be such a big deal, so we knocked everythingelse out first. Once we got to thewatchlist we realised that it wasn’t going to be aseasy as we thought. There were many factors towhy we couldn’t get the watchlist to work using thestar rating we had implemented. We triedmany different ways to try to fix it, Tianna McCoywas great at stirring us in the right direction
with coming up with a development plan to fix it but after hours of working with her we foundthat we had a few things missing, preventing us fromadding the watchlist. Manny Ledoux triedto help us come at adding a watch list from anotherangle and sure we broke some stuff, but atthe end of the day we decided we would keep workingon the watchlist adding it later but keptwhat we had to present.I think we came up with a great app that we all spenthours and hours putting together,our hard work, communication, team work, and strongwork ethic helped us accomplish a greatapp that we are all proud of!
